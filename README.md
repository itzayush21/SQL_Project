## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project showcases the end-to-end development of a modern **Data Warehouse** leveraging the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components
- **Data Architecture** â€“ Structured warehouse design using layered architecture.
- **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Extract, transform, and load data from multiple source systems.
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Creation of optimized fact and dimension tables for analytics.
- **Analytics & Reporting** â€“ SQL-based dashboards and reports for actionable insights.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable **Modern Data Warehouse** that follows the **Medallion Architecture** to ensure:
- **Reliable data ingestion** from multiple source systems.
- **Efficient transformation** and standardization across layers.
- **Optimized data models** for business analytics.
- **Actionable insights** through SQL-based reporting and dashboards.

## ðŸ”„ Process Undertaken
1. **Requirement Gathering & Planning**  
   - Identified business needs and analytical requirements.  
   - Selected data sources and defined data quality rules.

2. **Data Architecture Design**  
   - Designed the Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), and Gold (business-ready) layers.  
   - Created ER diagrams and data flow mappings.

3. **ETL Pipeline Development**  
   - Built extraction scripts to pull data from source systems.  
   - Applied transformations for standardization, cleansing, and enrichment.  
   - Loaded processed data into the warehouse.

4. **Data Modeling**  
   - Designed fact and dimension tables for analytical queries.  
   - Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, and indexing for performance.

5. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Created SQL queries for business KPIs.  
   - Developed dashboards and visual reports for stakeholders.

6. **Testing & Optimization**  
   - Validated data accuracy and completeness.  
   - Tuned queries and pipelines for performance efficiency.
